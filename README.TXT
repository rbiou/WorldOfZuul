INSTRUCTIONS A L'USAGER :
The aim is to move between rooms to find 4 vessel pieces. You can interact with pets, monsters 
and sellers during your journey in space. 
When you pet a pet, it gives you 1 gold as a reward. It also gives you the description of the planet.
The monsters are here to challenging you with an enigma. If you give the right answer, the monster rewards you with
300 golds. Otherwise, you loose 50HP. So be carreful before challenging it !
Different sellers are present all the game. You can sell them items you have found during your journey, or buy them
items like keys for example.
You have a bag where you can store objects but be careful : your bag has a limit of weight ! 
Also, planets have a limited time, depending on their atmosphere ! So do not stay too long on the same planet !
At the beginning of the game you have 100 life points but some traps are present in the game. 
You must be careful :)

Good luck and have fun ! :)
