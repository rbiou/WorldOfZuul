/**
 * Game class
 * 
 * The game is built in this class : 
 * First, planets and rooms are created. Rooms are added to the planets (not the same number of rooms in each planet). 
 * Then, exits(Door) are associated to the rooms (not the same number of exits in the rooms). 
 * A door can be a simple door (which is always opened) or a locked door. The latter is opened with a specific key. 
 * All the keys to open the locked door are in the chest or selling by the sellers : Key : price=300 & weight= 20
 * Other objects can be found (in a chest or thank to a seller) : 
 *      MagicBall : price=150  &  weight= 10
 *      Diamond : price=250  &  weight= 30
 *      Knief : price=50  &  weight= 5
 *      Fork : price= 3  &  weight= 5
 *      Vessel pieces : wheel/window/propullant/engine : available in a chest with : weight = 50
 * 
 * The player can also sell his own objects that he found to earn money. 
 * A chest can be trapped. In this case, the player loses 25 life points.
 * All objects that the player finds are added to his bag. It has a limit of weight. 
 * The player starts the game with 100 life points. 
 * 
 * The aim of the game is to find all the vessel pieces. In this way, the player who is lost in the space 
 * can repair his vessel and go back on earth. He has to move between the different rooms (so, he moves between planets) using
 * the door to find all the vessel pieces. 
 * 
 * During his journey to find his pieces of vessel, he can meet : pets and monsters. 
 * Pets are presents in the first room of each planet to explain the feature of the planet. 
 * There also pets that give money to the player (1 piece when he pets them)
 * Monsters can also interact with the player with enigmas. If the answer of the player is right, he earns 300pieces. 
 * In the other case, he loses 50 life points.
 * 
 * The player can stay on the planet during a specific time. Each planet has its specific features. 
 * If the time that he spends on the planet is to long, the player dies and returns to the beginning of the game.
